Hello! This is a personal website I've created as sort of an online resume / mini-portfolio. It is primarily based off of a template from colorlib, but has been tweaked with quite a bit to iron out some bugs and to get everything looking good. 

As of now, it includes the following sections:
- About Me
- Education
- Experience
- Recent Work
- Contact Me

Please let me know if you think I should include anything else or if you have feedback for the site. Cheers!
